CSE5335- jxv2205 - Project2

- I selected MongoDB NoSQL database as it is popular and I wanted an exposure. Besides, it is a document database that requires no joins
    and has a single structure. It is also easy to scale
- The installation and programming in nodejs was easy compared to Ruby on rails in the first project.
- I didnt find any aspect tough.
- For a professional development I would be most concerned about the security of the data, which is well covered by MongoDB.
